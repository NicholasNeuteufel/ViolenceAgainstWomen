ViolenceAgainstWomenAndChildren
===============================
Project by Nicholas Neuteufel while working for Tremendous Hearts (Cape Town, South Africa)


Written in R language, using UN Women data: http://www.endvawnow.org/uploads/browser/files/vawprevalence_matrix_june2013.pdf

Step 1: Mapping Out Violence (see Mapping) -- COMPLETE (http://imgur.com/H0W1OoO)


Step 2: The "Missing" Statistics--trying to predict missing data COMPLETE-ish

a) Linear regression -- impossible

b) Fixed-effects -- incomplete

c) Machine Learning -- completed

i) Neural nets -- unnecessary

ii) Random Forests -- complete (see ExperimentingDataImputation)

a) Try to get war/polity scores working. Then re-run imputation and step 3

b) Region analysis (Statistically analyzing trends by continent and regions within continents)


Step 3: Predicting key countries with missing data (with both 95% confidence and prediction intervals)

No particular order:

a) Asia: China, Koreas, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Indonesia.

b) Latin America: Argentina.

c) Africa: South Africa, Libya.

d) Europe: Spain, France.

e) North America: Cuba.

Step 4: Mapping the world; project evaluation.
