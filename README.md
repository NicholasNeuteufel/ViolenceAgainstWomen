STEP 2: The "Missing" Statistics--trying to predict missing data

A) Experimentally -- COMPLETE 

a) Random Forests (RF) -- complete (see ExperimentingDataImputation)


B) Empirically -- COMPLETE-ish

a) Using older data from WDI to fill-in incomplete cases (NAs) -- COMPLETE

b) Comparing empirical data to RF predicted imputation (pending C(a))


C) Overall

a) Try to get war/polity scores working. Then re-run both imputations.

b) Region analysis (Statistically analyzing trends by continent and regions within continents)

*****

STEP 3: Predicting key countries with missing data (with both 95% confidence and prediction intervals)

No particular order:

a) Asia: China, Koreas, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Indonesia.

b) Latin America: Argentina.

c) Africa: South Africa, Libya.

d) Europe: Spain, France.
