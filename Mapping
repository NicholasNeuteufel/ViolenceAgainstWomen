##Mapping violence against women worldwide. Example continent is Africa.

##Data from UN Women, compiled by Nick Neuteufel. Africa (example) data: https://www.dropbox.com/s/28idctnnnfokfus/AfricanVAW--Neuteufel.csv?dl=0


##Load data
data <- read.csv(file="AfricanVAW--Neuteufel.csv", h=T, sep=",")

##must-do
data$Country <- as.character(data$Country)

##pre-emptive change to name, to satisfy rworldmap. If you skip this, you will get failure in joinCountryData2Map
data$Country[data$Country=="DRC"] <- "Democratic Republic of Congo"


##Mapping

library(rworldmap)
map <- joinCountryData2Map(data, nameJoinColumn="Country", joinCode="NAME", verbose=T)

###Should get this response
22 codes from your data successfully matched countries in the map
0 codes from your data failed to match with a country code in the map
     failedCodes failedCountries
222 codes from the map weren't represented in your data

###Oceania response to joinCountryData2Map should be:
9 codes from your data successfully matched countries in the map
0 codes from your data failed to match with a country code in the map
     failedCodes failedCountries
235 codes from the map weren't represented in your data
